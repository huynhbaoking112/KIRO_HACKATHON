# Business & Organizational Problem Brainstorming Workflow

This steering file provides guidance for brainstorming business, organizational, and process-related problems.

## Business Problem Framework

When the user presents a business or organizational problem, follow this approach:

### Phase 1: Business Context Gathering

Ask these questions:
1. **Problem Scope**: Who is affected? (Team, department, company, customers?)
2. **Current State**: What's happening now that's problematic?
3. **Desired State**: What does success look like?
4. **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, organizational politics, existing commitments?
5. **Stakeholders**: Who needs to approve or be involved?
6. **Previous Attempts**: What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?
7. **Metrics**: How will you measure success?

### Phase 2: Research Strategy

For business problems:

1. **Web Search Focus**:
   - Industry best practices
   - Case studies from similar companies
   - Expert opinions and frameworks
   - Recent trends and innovations
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

2. **Look for**:
   - Proven frameworks (OKRs, Agile, Design Thinking, etc.)
   - Success stories with measurable results
   - Failure stories and lessons learned
   - Tools and platforms that enable solutions
   - Change management strategies

### Phase 3: Solution Evaluation Criteria

For business solutions, evaluate based on:

**Impact**
- Direct benefit to the problem
- Ripple effects (positive and negative)
- Short-term vs long-term value

**Feasibility**
- Resource requirements (people, time, money)
- Organizational readiness
- Technical/logistical complexity
- Risk level

**Adoption**
- Stakeholder buy-in likelihood
- Change management needs
- Training requirements
- Cultural fit

**Sustainability**
- Ongoing maintenance effort
- Scalability as organization grows
- Flexibility to adapt

**ROI**
- Cost vs benefit analysis
- Time to value
- Measurable outcomes

### Phase 4: Solution Presentation Format

Present business solutions with this structure:

**Solution [N]: [Approach Name]**

**Overview**: One-sentence description of the approach

**How It Works**:
- Key steps or components
- Required resources
- Timeline estimate

**Pros**:
- ✅ Primary benefits
- ✅ Secondary advantages
- ✅ Success examples

**Cons**:
- ❌ Challenges and risks
- ❌ Resource requirements
- ❌ Potential resistance

**Best For**: 
- Organizational contexts where this excels
- Team sizes or structures that benefit most

**Implementation Steps**:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. ...

**Success Metrics**:
- How to measure if this is working

**Resources**:
- [Framework Documentation](url)
- [Case Study](url)
- [Tools/Platforms](url)

**Estimated Timeline**: [Weeks/Months]
**Estimated Cost**: [Budget range if applicable]

### Phase 5: Implementation Planning

After presenting solutions, help with:
1. "Which solution has the best chance of stakeholder buy-in?"
2. "What quick wins can you achieve first?"
3. "What risks concern you most?"
4. "Do you need help creating a pitch or implementation plan?"

## Example Business Brainstorm Session

**User**: "How to solve team communication issues in remote work?"

**Agent Response**:

"I'll help you find effective solutions for remote team communication. Let me understand your situation better:

1. How large is your team? (5, 20, 100+ people?)
2. What time zones are you working across?
3. What communication tools do you currently use?
4. What specific issues are you experiencing? (Too many meetings? Slow responses? Misalignment?)
5. What's your team's work style? (Mostly async or need real-time collaboration?)
6. Any budget constraints for new tools?

Based on your answers, I'll research and present solutions like:
- Async-first communication framework
- Structured meeting protocols
- Documentation culture implementation
- Communication tool optimization
- Team rituals and bonding activities

Each with pros/cons and implementation guidance for your specific context."

## Tips for Business Brainstorming

1. **Focus on People**: Technology is easy, changing behavior is hard
2. **Start Small**: Pilot programs before full rollout
3. **Measure Everything**: Define success metrics upfront
4. **Get Buy-in Early**: Involve stakeholders in the solution design
5. **Plan for Resistance**: Change management is critical
6. **Iterate**: Be ready to adjust based on feedback
7. **Document Decisions**: Create a clear rationale for future reference
8. **Celebrate Wins**: Recognize progress to maintain momentum

## Change Management Considerations

When presenting solutions, always address:
- **Communication Plan**: How to announce and explain the change
- **Training Needs**: What people need to learn
- **Feedback Loops**: How to gather input and adjust
- **Champions**: Who will advocate for the change
- **Timeline**: Realistic rollout schedule
- **Rollback Plan**: What if it doesn't work?
